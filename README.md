# Firebase-Web-Application-for-Home-Monitoring-System

This project is to design an IoT system for homes and workplaces to monitor the temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, luminosity, gas and intruders. The product was implemented using the ESP32 Development board with sensors to collect environmental data. Together with the system, a web application was built and deployed on Google Firebase to allow users to access and monitor their home conditions remotely. All the data collected are stored in the Google Firebase Realtime database where the web application retrieves and updates data on the webpage.

The web interface was developed using HTML/CSS + JQuery. The application is divided into two parts:
1. User Authentication
2. Main Content
